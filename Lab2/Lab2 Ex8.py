# **Assignment 8: Using Break in a Loop**
# **Topic**: Loops Flow Control
# **Objective**: Understand how to use the break statement to exit a loop early.
# 1. Use a for loop to iterate over the numbers from 1 to 10 using range function.
# 2. Use a break statement to exit the loop when the number is 5.
# 3. Print the numbers iterated before the break.

for i in range(1,101):
    if(i<5):
        print(i)
    else:
        break
