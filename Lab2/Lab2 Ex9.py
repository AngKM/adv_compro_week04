# **Assignment 9: Using Continue in a Loop**
# **Topic**: Loops Flow Control
# **Objective**: Understand how to use the continue statement to skip iterations in a loop.
# 1. Use a for loop to iterate over the numbers from 1 to 10 using range function.
# 2. Apply a continue statement to skip the number 5.
# 3. Print number of each loop

for i in range(1,11):
    if(i==5):
        continue
    else:
        print(i)
